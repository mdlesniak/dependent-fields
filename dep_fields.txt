Dependent fields

This exercise will help you understand how to test drive in JavaScript.
You should be able to come away with a better understanding of
how to set up tests for requirements using Jasmine, and should
be able to use jQuery to look for and manipulate DOM elements.

A client wants a survey made, and you are responsible for the UI.
This survey is web based and uses jQuery for other DOM responsiblities,
so you are able to utilize that library.

The client is interested in how much of their product is used by
the person taking the survey. So they have several questions to be
asked, and some of those questions will prompt other questions to
show.

The client has these questions and fields to collect:
Do you eat SuperAwesome Chocolate Bars?
(user can choose "Yes" or "No")
  If "No", hide the ""
  If "Yes"
    How many do you eat per week?
	(user can type any number)
	  If number > 5, then show a "Thanks for being a great customer!" message
    For how many years have you been eating SuperAwesome Chocolate Bars?
    (user can type any number)
      If number > 3, then show a "Thanks for being so loyal!" message
    Will you try to cut back on your SuperAwesome Chocolate Bar consumption?
    (user can choose "Yes" or "No")
      If "No", hide the "Why" question
      If "Yes"
      Why?
      (user can choose any of the following)
        Health reasons
        They taste bad now
        Moving to Slugworth Chocolates
        Alien abduction has altered my state of being
        I lied; I don't eat your chocolate

Form validation is not necessary at this time.
